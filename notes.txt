TDD is a state of mind!

State goal, check, fix.
One at a time.
only write the nexessary amount of code to fix the issue.

Include the word test in func name as defalt for pytest

*r ???

Simple solution 1st.

Write the test first.

Single assertions, for different cases write more tests - unlike codewars?

// or / for divide what's the difference?

pytest func exists to give approx. in cases of irrational numbers. Specifying decimel places.

with in python is a context manager

Name tests well, long and explicit

Mock files in testing stop test suit from downloading masses of data
